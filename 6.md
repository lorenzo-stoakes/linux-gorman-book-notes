# Chapter 6: Physical Page Allocation

* Physical pages are managed using the 'binary buddy allocator', originally
  devised by Knowlton and further described by Knuth ([TAocP][taocp] Volume 1,
  Section 2.5, pg. 442) and has shown to be extremely fast compared to other
  allocators (see David G. Korn and Kiem-Phong Bo. In search of a better malloc
  In Proceedings of the Summer 1985 USENIX Conference, pages 489–506, Portland,
  OR, 1985.)

* This is an allocation scheme that combines a power-or-two allocator with free
  buffer coalescing.

* The concept behind a binary buddy allocator is quite simple:

1. Memory is broken up into large blocks of pages where each block is a power
   of 2 number of pages.

2. If a block of the desired size is not available a large block is broken up in
   half and the two blocks are considered 'buddies' to each other - one half is
   used for the allocation, the other is free.

3. The blocks are continuously halved as necessary until a block of the desired
   size is available.

4. When a block is freed the buddy is examined, and the two are coalesced if it
   is free.

## 6.1 Managing Free Blocks

* The allocator maintains blocks of free pages where each block is a
  power-of-two number of pages.

* The exponent of the power of 2 is referred to as its _order_.

* An array of [free_area_t][free_area_t] structs are maintained for each order
  each of which point to a linked list of blocks of pages that are free, e.g.:

```
order    free_area_t             Free page blocks
       zone->free_area
     |---------------|-|
|    |       0       | | -> [] -> [] -> ...       2^0 page-sized blocks
|    |---------------|-|
|    |       1       | |
|    |---------------|-|
|    |       2       | |
|    |---------------|-|
|    |       3       | |
|    |---------------|-|
|    |       4       | | -> [==] -> [==] -> ...   2^4 page-sized blocks
|    |---------------|-|
|    |       5       | |
|    |---------------|-|
|    |       6       | |
|    |---------------|-|
|    |       7       | |
|    |---------------|-|
|    |       8       | |
|    |---------------|-|
|    |       9       | | -> [==========] -> ...   2^(MAX_ORDER - 1) page-sized blocks
|    |---------------|-|
|    |   MAX_ORDER   | | (exclusive bound)
v    |---------------|-|
```

* [MAX_ORDER][MAX_ORDER] is currently set at 10 unless otherwise specified by
  `CONFIG_FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER`. This eliminates the chance that a larger block
  will be split to satisfy a request where a smaller block would suffice.

* The page blocks are maintained on a linear linked list using
  [struct page][page]`->list`.

* Each zone has a [free_area_t][free_area_t] array field of `free_area[MAX_ORDER]`.

* Looking at `free_area_t` itself:

```c
typedef struct free_area_struct {
        struct list_head        free_list;
        unsigned long           *map;
} free_area_t;
```

* `free_list` is a linked list of free page blocks, `map` is a bitmap
  representing the state of a pair of buddies.

* Linux saves memory by using one bit instead of two to represent each pair of
  buddies - each time a buddy is allocated or freed, the bit representing the
  pair of buddies is toggled so that the bit is 0 if the pair of pages are both
  free or both full and 1 if only one buddy is in use.

* To toggle the correct bit, the macro [MARK_USED()][MARK_USED] is used:

```c
#define MARK_USED(index, order, area) \
        __change_bit((index) >> (1+(order)), (area)->map)
```

* `index` is the index of the page within the global [mem_map][mem_map] array.

* The correct bit to flip is determined by shifting `index` right by `1 +
  order`. LS - Need to understand this better.

* [__change_bit()][__change_bit] ultimately uses the [btc][btc] 'bit test and
  complement' op-code.

## 6.2 Allocating Pages

* Let's have a look at the Linux API for the allocation of page frames:

1. [alloc_page()][alloc_page] - Allocats a single page and returns a
   [struct page][page].
2. [alloc_pages()][alloc_pages] - Allocates `2^order` pages and returns a
   `struct page`.
3. [get_free_page()][get_free_page] - Allocates a single page, zeroes it and
   returns a virtual address (deprecated name, macro wrapper for
   [get_zeroed_page()][get_zeroed_page].)
4. [__get_free_page()][__get_free_page] - Allocates a single page and returns a
   virtual address.
5. [__get_free_pages()][__get_free_pages] - Allocates `2^order` pages and
   returns a virtual address.
6. [__get_dma_pages()][__get_dma_pages] - Allocates `2^order` pages from
   `ZONE_DMA` and returns a `struct page`.

* Each of these functions take an integer `gfp_mask` parameter which is a set of
  flags that determine how the allocator will behave (discussed further in 6.4.)

* They all ultimately use the core function [__alloc_pages()][__alloc_pages],
  the reason these are provided is so the correct node and zone will be
  used. Different users will require different zones - some device drivers will
  need `ZONE_DMA`, disk buffers will need `ZONE_NORMAL` and callers shouldn't
  have to be aware of which node is being used.

* Allocations are always for a specified order - 0 when only a single page is
  required.

* If a free block can't be found of the requested order, a higher order block is
  split into two buddies - one is allocated and the other is placed on the free
  list for the lower order.

* For example, a process requesting a 2^2 block when one is not available, nor
  2^3, but a 2^4 block is:

```
order    free_area_t             Free page blocks
       zone->free_area
     |---------------|-|
|    |       0       | |            Requesting Process
|    |---------------|-|                    ^
|    |       1       | |                    |
|    |---------------|-|                    |
|    |       2       | | <---------------\  |
|    |---------------|-|                 |  |
|    |       3       | | <----------\  [==|==]
|    |---------------|-|            |     ^
|    |       4       | | ---\       |     |
|    |---------------|-|    |    [=====|=====]
|    |       5       | |    |          ^
|    |---------------|-|    |          |
|    |       6       | |    \--->[===========]
|    |---------------|-|
|    |       7       | |
|    |---------------|-|
|    |       8       | |
|    |---------------|-|
|    |       9       | |
|    |---------------|-|
|    |   MAX_ORDER   | |
v    |---------------|-|
```

* When a block is later freed, the buddy will be checked. If both are free, they
  are merged to form a higher order block and placed on the higher free list
  where its buddy is checked and so on.

* If the buddy is not free, the freed block will be placed on the free list at
  the current order.

* During these operations interrupts have to be disabled to prevent an interrupt
  handler manipulating the lists while a process has them in an inconsistent
  state - this is achieved by using an interrupt safe spinlock.

* The next decision that needs to be made is which memory node or
  [pg_data_t][pg_data_t] to use. Linux uses a node-local allocation policy - it
  aims to use the memory bank associated with the CPU running the
  page-allocating process.

* The function `_alloc_pages()` differs depending on the system type -
  [UMA _alloc_pages()][_alloc_pages/uma] and
  [NUMA _alloc_pages()][_alloc_pages/numa].

* Regardless of what API is used, [__alloc_pages()][__alloc_pages] is the heart
  of the allocator (note this function is never called directly.), it:

1. Examines the selected zone and checks whether it is suitable to allocate from
   based on the number of available pages.

2. If the zone is not available, the allocator may fall back to other zones. The
   order of zones to fall back on is decided at boot time by
   [build_zonelists()][build_zonelists], though generally `ZONE_HIGHMEM` falls
   back to `ZONE_NORMAL` which in turn will fall back to `ZONE_DMA`.

3. If the number of free pages reaches the zone's `pages_low` watermark, it will
   wake `kswapd` to begin freeing up pages from zones, and if memory is
   extremely tight, it will do the work of `kswapd` itself.

4. After the zone has been decided on, the function [rmqueue()][rmqueue] is
   called to allocate the block of pages or split higher level blocks if one of
   the appropriate size is not available.

## 6.3 Free Pages

* The API for freeing of pages is a lot simpler and exists to help remember the
  order of the block to free - this is one disadvantage of a buddy allocator -
  the caller has to remember the size of hte original allocation.

* Let's take a look at the API:

1. [__free_pages()][__free_pages] - Given a [struct page][page], Frees `2^order`
   pages from the given page.
2. [__free_page()][__free_page] - Given a [struct page][page], frees it.
3. [free_page()][free_page] - Given a virtual address, frees a page from it.

* The principle function is [__free_pages_ok()][__free_pages_ok], which should
  not be called directly, rather [__free_pages()][__free_pages] performs simple
  checks first.

* When a buddy is freed linux tries to coalesce the buddies together
  immediately, if possible. This is not optimal, because in the worst-case
  scenario there will be many coalitions followed by the immediate splitting of
  the same blocks.

* To detect whether the buddies can be merged, linux checks the bit
  corresponding to the affected pair of buddies in `free_area->map`.

* Recall that we track buddy status using a single bit - 0 if both are set or
  free, 1 if one is set and the other not. Since we just freed a buddy, we know
  that a 0 implies both are free, so we can go ahead and merge.

* We can calculate the address of the buddy relatively easily - since the
  allocations are always in blocks of size `2^k`, the address of the block or at
  least its offset within the `zone_mem_map` will also be a power of `2^k` -
  this means that the binary representation of this address will always have at
  least `k` zeros to the right of the address.

* The buddy will have the `k`th bit flipped. Here `imask` provides a mask for just
  that bit:

```
mask = (~0 << k)
imask = 1+~mask = -mask
```

* After the buddy is merged, it is removed from the free list and the newly
  coalesced pair moves to the next higher order to see if it may also be merged
  with its buddy there.

* Quoting from Knuth ([TAocP][taocp] Volume 1, Section 2.5, pg. 442):

>The key fact underlying the practical usefulness of this method is that if we
>know the address of a block (the memory location of its first word), and if we
>also know the size of that block, we know the address of its buddy. For
>example, the buddy of the block of size 16 beginning in binary location
>101110010110000 is a block starting in binary location 101110010100000. To see
>why this must be true, we first observe that as the algorithm proceeds, the
>address of a block of size `2^k` is a multiple of `2^k`. In other words, the
>address in binary notation has at least `k` zeros at the right. This
>observation is easily justified by induction: If it is true for all blocks of
>size `2^(k+1)`, it is certainly true when such a block is halved.  Therefore a
>block of size, say, 32 has an address of the form xx. . . x00000 (where the x’s
>represent either 0 or 1); if it is split, the newly formed buddy blocks have
>the addresses xx. . . x00000 and xx. . . x10000.

* Considering an example of order 2 allocations - addresses will look like
  `0101100`, `0111100`, `1000000`, etc. - we are allocating `2^2` pages at a
  time. If we need to split an address, the first of the two buddies will be the
  existing address, the second half way through, i.e. `address + 2^1`, so
  `0111100` will split to `0111100` and `0111110` - and the condition holds
  true.

## 6.4 Get Free Page (GFP) Flags

* A concept that is maintained throughout the VM is the Get Free Page (GFP)
  flags. These determine how the allocator and `kswapd` will behave for the
  allocation and freeing of pages.

* For example, an interrupt handler is not allowed to sleep, so it will _not_
  set `__GFP_WAIT` which indicates the caller may sleep.

* There are 3 sets of GFP flags all [set in include/linux/mm.h][gfp-flags]. The
  first set are _zone modifiers_:

1. `__GFP_DMA` - Allocate from `ZONE_DMA` if possible.

2. `__GFP_HIGHMEM` - Allocate from `ZONE_HIGHMEM` if possible.

3. `GFP_DMA` - Alias for `__GFP_DMA`.

* There isn't a zone modifier for `ZONE_NORMAL`, as this is the default (the
  zone modifier flag is used as an offset within an array and `ZONE_NORMAL` is
  offset 0.)

* The second set are _action modifiers_ - they change the behaviour of the VM
  and what the calling process may do:

1. `__GFP_WAIT` - The caller is not high priority and can sleep or reschedule.

2. `__GFP_HIGH` - Used by a high priority or kernel process (LS - the book says
   it's unused, but I see it in the 4.5 kernel so I'm not going to mark it as
   unused here in case 2.4.22 uses it too.)

3. `__GFP_IO` - The caller can perform low-level I/O. The main effect in 2.4.22
   is to determine whether [try_to_free_buffers()][try_to_free_buffers] can
   flush buffers. It is also used by at least one journaled filesystem.

4. `__GFP_HIGHIO` - Determines that I/O can be performed on pages mapped into
   high memory. Only used in `try_to_free_buffers()`.

5. `__GFP_FS` - The caller can make calls to the filesystem layer - this is
   provided when the caller is filesystem-related (e.g. the buffer cache), and
   wants to avoid recursively calling itself.

* These low-level flags on their own are too primitive to be easily used as-is,
  and it is often difficult to know the appropriate combination of these to use,
  which brings us to the third set - high-level combinations of the low-level
  action modifiers. These are more digestible forms of the primitives:

```c
#define GFP_NOHIGHIO    (__GFP_HIGH | __GFP_WAIT | __GFP_IO)
#define GFP_NOIO        (__GFP_HIGH | __GFP_WAIT)
#define GFP_NOFS        (__GFP_HIGH | __GFP_WAIT | __GFP_IO | __GFP_HIGHIO)
#define GFP_ATOMIC      (__GFP_HIGH)
#define GFP_USER        (             __GFP_WAIT | __GFP_IO | __GFP_HIGHIO | __GFP_FS)
#define GFP_HIGHUSER    (             __GFP_WAIT | __GFP_IO | __GFP_HIGHIO | __GFP_FS | __GFP_HIGHMEM)
#define GFP_KERNEL      (__GFP_HIGH | __GFP_WAIT | __GFP_IO | __GFP_HIGHIO | __GFP_FS)
#define GFP_NFS         (__GFP_HIGH | __GFP_WAIT | __GFP_IO | __GFP_HIGHIO | __GFP_FS)
#define GFP_KSWAPD      (             __GFP_WAIT | __GFP_IO | __GFP_HIGHIO | __GFP_FS)
```

* Considering each of these:

1. `GFP_NOHIGHIO` - This is only used in one place -
   [alloc_bounce_page()][alloc_bounce_page] - during the creation of a bounce
   buffer for I/O in high memory.
2. `GFP_NOIO` - This is used by callers who are already performing I/O, for
   example when the loopback device is trying to get a page for a buffer head,
   it uses this flag to make sure it doesn't introduce more I/O. In fact, it
   seems like the flag was introduced specifically to avoid a deadlock in the
   loopback device :)
3. `GFP_NOFS` - This issued only by the buffer cache and filesystems to make
   sure sure they do not recursively call themselves by accident.
4. `GFP_ATOMIC` - Used whenever the caller cannot sleep and must be serviced if
   at all possible. Any interrupt handler that requires memory must use this
   flag to avoid sleeping or performing I/O. Many subsystems use this system
   during init, e.g. [buffer_init()][buffer_init] or [inode_init()][inode_init].
5. `GFP_USER` - Defunct - this is a flag of historic interest - in the 2.2.x
   series memory was assigned low, medium, or high priority - if memory was
   tight, a request with `GFP_USER` (low priority) would fail whereas others
   would keep trying. Now it has no impact and is treated no differently than
   `GFP_KERNEL`.
6. `GFP_HIGHUSER` - The allocator should allocate from `ZONE_HIGHMEM` if
   possible - used when the page is allocated on behalf of a user process.
7. `GFP_KERNEL` - This is the most liberal of the combined flags - the caller is
   free to do whatever they want.
8. `GFP_NFS` - Defunct - in the 2.0.x series this flag would determine what the
   reserved page size was - usually this was 20, if this flag was set it'd
   be 5. Now this flag is identical to `GFP_KERNEL`.
9. `GFP_KSWAPD` - Defunct - Effectively the same as `GFP_KERNEL`, modulo
   `__GFP_HIGH`.
